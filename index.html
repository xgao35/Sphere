In my UI/UX course, each team is tasked to iteratively design a piece of user experience for a startup's product, without seeing their actual product. With a passion for education technology, my team chose Sphere. </p>

                        <li class="none">User 2: The static menu on the bottom is really useful and prevents the user from being lost</li>

            <h3>Conclusions & Lessons </h3>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Feedback is important in making sure that every aspect of the design is intentional.</b> In this project, peer and user feedback for the first two mockups picked out many design choices that were not thoroughly considered from a user perspective. It is impossible to design completely without a bias towards what makes sense for oneself, so thinking iteratively with feedback along the way is extremely important.</li>
                <li><b>User logic can be very different from the designer's logic.</b> The user testing videos showed me this principle in action for the first time. All of the users completed the assigned task from vastly different routes. For instance, to message the instructor, one user found the "direct message" button, but chose a more complicated route of navigating to the direct message page via finding the same icon in the navigation bar. To address this variety of user navigation logic, the designer must consider multiple routes to accomplish the same task.</li>
                <li><b>Information needs to be very obvious for users to learn. </b>The design of the instructor star icon and navigation bar without labels were not intuitive for the users because the presentation of information is not immediately significant enough. People have a limited scope of attention, so to make the user's first encounter with the product is as easy as possible, they should not be expected to learn icons and navigations unless the instructions are exceedingly clear. </li>
